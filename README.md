## 📝 Project Overview
This repository showcases the data analytics and machine learning projects completed during my internship at **Oasis Infobyte**. The work is structured into two distinct levels, transitioning from exploratory data analysis to advanced predictive modeling.


## 💻 Environment & Tools
All projects were developed and executed within the **Anaconda** ecosystem using **Jupyter Notebooks**. This environment was chosen to ensure a robust, reproducible workflow for data manipulation, statistical modeling, and visualization.


## 📁 Repository Structure

### Level 1: Foundational Data Analytics
1. **EDA on Retail Sales Data:** Comprehensive exploration of sales trends, seasonality, and consumer behavior.
2. **Customer Segmentation:** Utilizing clustering techniques to categorize customers based on purchasing profiles.
3. **Cleaning Data:** Implementation of robust preprocessing pipelines to ensure data integrity and quality.

### Level 2: Intermediate Analysis & Modeling
1. **Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression:** Development of a regression framework for accurate real estate valuation.
2. **Wine Quality Prediction:** Deployment of classification algorithms (Random Forest, SGD, and SVC) to determine quality grades.
3. **Unveiling the Android App Market:** In-depth analysis of the Google Play Store, combining market metrics with user sentiment polarity.



## 🛠️ Technical Stack & Skills
* **Environment:** Anaconda (Jupyter Notebooks)
* **Data Manipulation:** Python (Pandas, NumPy)
* **Statistical Visualization:** Seaborn & Matplotlib (Focused on Data-Ink ratio and Color Theory)
* **Machine Learning:** Regression, Classification, and Model Evaluation (Scikit-Learn)
* **Reporting:** Integrated Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) and accessible HTML reports
